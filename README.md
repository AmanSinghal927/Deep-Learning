# Deep Learning Repository

This repository consists of Jupyter notebooks and resources that cover various deep learning topics and algorithms. The notebooks include practical implementations of different algorithms, while the PDFs cover theoretical aspects.

## Content

1. [MLP Implementation](mlp.ipynb): This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a class of feedforward artificial neural network.
   
2. [SGD Implementation](sgd.ipynb): In this Jupyter notebook, you'll find the implementation of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), a simple yet very efficient approach to fitting linear classifiers and regressors under convex loss functions.
   
3. [Image Segmentation using U-Net](Image_segmentation.ipynb): This Jupyter notebook demonstrates Image Segmentation, a key topic in image processing, using the U-Net architecture.
   
4. [Propagation of Gradients - Basics](basics.pdf): This PDF is a resource that provides a deep dive into the basics of propagation of gradients, an important concept in neural network training.
   
5. [Propagation of Gradients in CNNs and RNNs](cnn_rnn_basics.pdf): This PDF resource explains the theory behind propagation of gradients in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
   
6. [Theory and Intuition behind Transformers](transformers.pdf): This PDF provides an in-depth understanding of the theory and intuition behind Transformers, a novel type of neural network architecture used in state-of-the-art models like BERT, GPT-3, etc.
   
7. [Vision Transformer Implementation](vision_transformer.ipynb): This Jupyter notebook provides a from-scratch implementation of Vision Transformers using PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework.
